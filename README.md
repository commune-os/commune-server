#### Commune

Commune lets you build free and open public communities on a Matrix server. It transforms a Matrix server into a publicly accessible community platform. The goal is to make it easy for existing homeserver operators to open up their Matrix instance (or a subset of it) to the web, and add extra community features using native Matrix functionality.

Conceptual Introduction: [Communal Bonfires](https://blog.erlend.sh/communal-bonfires).

We're operating these live instances at the moment:

- [commune.sh](https://commune.sh) 

#### What does it do?
Commune opens up all spaces and underlying rooms to the web by reading data directly from the Synapse DB, bypassing Synapse's client-server API. Additional features such as discussion boards, threaded comments are rendered by the [client](https://github.com/commune-os/commune-client). Commune makes use of many [materialized views](https://github.com/commune-os/commune-server/tree/main/db/matrix/views) for querying Synapse events.

##### Short-term roadmap
- [x] Federation between Commune instances
- [ ] Social login support
- [ ] ActivityPub support for interacting with the fediverse
- [ ] Private spaces/boards and Encrypted DMs
- [ ] Simplify self-hosting deployment

#### How to run

##### Requirements
- Synapse
- Redis
- S3-compatible object storage (optional)
- Email/SMTP provider (optional)

You'll need to set up a matrix/synapse server. Existing servers can be used too, but Commune is highly experimental at the moment, so it's best to set up a new homeserver.

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `make deps` to fetch dependencies.
3. Copy `config-sample.toml` to `config.toml`. Update the config with your
   Synapse details.
4. Run `make` to build the app.
5. Run the `db/matrix/views/creates.sh` script to create materialized views.
6. Run `modd` to run app locally while developing.
7. To deploy, put the app behind `nginx`.

Finally, you'll need to go install the
[client](https://github.com/commune-os/commune-client) and point it to your
Commune backend.

##### WARNING
Commune is operating in `world_readable` mode. This means that everything on your matrix server has the potential to be accessible from the web. No work has been put into private spaces/rooms or encryption. Unless explicitly stated, assume that every event on a Commune-based matrix server will be public.
